I am statistician turned data scientist, currently working at [funda](https://www.funda.nl/). I am a true data junkie, I just love to play around with data. After doing bachelor programs in psychology and history I did the [Statistical Science](http://en.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/statistical-science-for-the-life-and-behavioural-sciences/en/introduction) program at Leiden University, at which I [completed my MSc](https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/scripties/MasterThoen.pdf) with professor Hein Putter. From the moment I started R programming I was hooked, and it always remained my weapon of choice. However, I try to keep an open mind by exploring other tools as well. 

My current interests are using Bayesian models to do machine learning, how to keep a good workflow (and how well does the agile approach fit data science), enable others to do data analysis and what is the best approach to enjoy the work as much as we can. If you like to correspond about any of these topics or other things mentioned in one of the blogs I would love to hear from you.

I am the author and maintainer of the [`padr`](https://github.com/EdwinTh/padr) R package. A fair share of my blogs will be about this package.

Besides a data junkie and R programmer I am a bit of a foodie, an enthusiastic (albeit not overly talented) tennis player, a coffee and wine lover, a sports buff and an avid traveler.
