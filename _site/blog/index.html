You will find the main changes in the thicken function, that has gained two new arguments. First of all, by an idea of Adam Stone, you are now enabled to drop the original datetime variable from the data frame by using drop = TRUE. This argument defaults to FALSE to ensure backwards compatibility. Without setting drop to TRUE the datetime variable will be returned alongside the added, thickened variable:</span></a></article></li>

For a sports buff like me, it is the essence of summer (together with the Tour de France). Time to dive into some tennis data. As a follower of both the men’s and the women’s tour it occurred to me that in the latter the tournaments are less predictable. My gut feel was that in the men’s matches the favourite wins the match more frequently than at women’s matches. Of course gut feels are what the world makes go round, unless you are a data scientist. So lets analyse all the matches that were played at the four Grand Slam tournamants for the past fourty years.</span></a></article></li>

Computations are done in a separate R session that is not interactive, but just runs the script. In the meantime your regular R session stays live so you can do other work while waiting for the Job to complete. Instead refreshing your Twitter for the 156th time, you can stay productive! (I am actually writing this blog in Rmarkdown while I am waiting for my results to come in.) The number of jobs you can spin-up is not limited to one. As each new job is started at a different core, you can start as many jobs as your system got cores (although leaving one idle is a good idea for other processes, like your interactive R session).</span></a></article></li>

It is an empirical one, based on several years of doing data science projects in different organisations. Here it is: The probability that you have worked on a data science project that failed, approaches one very quickly as the number of projects done grows. I think many, far more than we as a community like to admit, will deal with projects that don’t meet their objectives. This blog does not explore why data science projects have a high risk of failing. Jacqueline Nolis already  did this adequately. Rather, I’ll look for strategies how we might deal with projects that are failing. Disappointing as they may be, failed projects are inherently part of the novel and challenging discipline data science is in many organisations. The following approach might reduce the probability of failure, but that is not the main point. Their objective is to prevent failing in silence after too long a period of project time. In which you try to figure out things on your own. They will shift failure from the silent personal domain to the public collective one. Hopefully, reducing stress and blame by yourself and others.</span></a></article></li>

One of those people was actually yours truely a few years back. Person is aware of S3 methods in R through regular use of print, plot and summary functions and decides to give it a go in own work. Creates a function that assigns a class to its output and then implements a bunch of methods to work on the class. Strangely, some of these methods appear to be working as expected, while others throw an error. After a confusing and painful debugging session, person throws hands in the air and continues working without S3 methods. Which was working fine in the first place. This is a real pity, because all the person is overlooking is a very small step in the S3 chain: the generic function.</span></a></article></li>

A recipe object is a container that holds all the steps that should be performed to go from the raw data set to the set that is fed into model a algorithm. Once your recipe is ready it can be executed on a data set at once, to perform all the steps. Not only on the train set on which the recipe was created, but also on new data, such as test sets and data that should be scored by the model. This assures that new data gets the exact same preparation as the train set, and thus can be validly scored by the learned model. The author of recipes, Max Kuhn, has provided abundant material to familiarize yourself with the richness of the package, see here, here, and here. I will not dwell on how to use the package. Rather, I’d like to share what in my opinion is a good way to create new steps and checks to the package1. Use of the package is probably intuitive. Developing new steps and checks, however, does require a little more understanding of the package inner workings. With this procedure, or recipe if you like, I hope you will find adding (and maybe even contributing) your own steps and checks becomes easier and more organized.            Together with Max I added the checks framework to the package. Where steps are transformations of variables, checks are assertions of them. If a check passes nothing happens. If it fails, it will break the bake method of the recipe and throws an informative error. &#8617;      </span></a></article></li>

As mentioned I shamelessly copied the package. I replaced the list with character vectors containing hex colors and did a find and replace to make it dutchmasters instead of ochRe. This was pretty ugly.  I realized that when we would refactor the  ochRe functions, thus creating functions that create the functions, there would no longer be a need to copy-paste and find-and-replace. So that is what I did. I refactored and expanded ochRe’s chore into paletti. (Name chosen because I liked the ring of it). You grab it from Github, with devtools::install_github(&quot;edwinth/paletti&quot;).</span></a></article></li>

And for very good reasons! During the seventeenth century, known as the Dutch Golden Age, there was an abundance of talented painters. If you ever havethe chance to visit the Rijksmuseum you will be in awe by the landscapes,households and portraits, painted with incredible detail and beautiful colors.</span></a></article></li>

I certainly did not pick up many skills in that direction during my statistics masters. For years my workflow was basically load a dataset and hack away on it. In the best case my R-script came to some kind of conclusion or final data set, but usually it abruptly ended. Complex projects could result in a great number of scripts and data exports. Needless to say, reproducability was typically low and stress could run high when some delivery went wrong.</span></a></article></li>

Recently I revisited the post and saw that Z.Lin did a very nice and more modern implementation, using dplyr and facetting in ggplot2. I decided to merge here ideas with mine to create a general function that makes MM plots. I also added two features: counts, proportions, or percentages to the cells as text and highlighting cells by a condition.</span></a></article></li>

What makes this one so challenging to get your mind around, is that the Honorable Doctor Sir Lord General and friends brought concepts to the realm of the mortals that many of us had no, or only a vague, understanding of. Earlier, I gave an overview of the most common actions in tidy eval. Although appreciated by many, it left me unsatisfied, because it made clear to me I did not really understand NSE. Neither in base R, nor in tidy eval. Therefore, I bit the bullet and really studied it for a few evenings. Starting with base R NSE, and later learning what tidy eval actually adds to it. I decided to share the things I learned in this, rather lengthy, blog. I think it captures the essentials in NSE, although it surely is incomplete and might be even erronous at places. Still, I hope you find it worthwhile and it will help you understand NSE better and apply it with more confidence.</span></a></article></li>

Even after reading programming with dplyr several times, I still struggle when creating functions from time to time. I made a small summary of the most common actions I perform, so I don’t have to dig in the vignettes and on stackoverflow over and over. Each is accompanied with a minimal example on how to implement it. I thought others might find this useful too, so here it is in a blog post. This list is meant to be a living thing so additions and improvements are most welcome. Please do a PR on this file or send an email.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/span_date_time/">Span Dates and Times without Overhead <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-07-26T19:00:00+02:00">July 26, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I am working on v.0.4.0 of the padr package this summer. Two new features that will be added are wrappers around seq.Date and seq.POSIXt. Since it is going to take a while before the new release is on CRAN, I go ahead and do an early presentation of these functions. Date and datetime parsing in base R are powerful and comprehensive, but also tedious. They can slow you down in your programming or analysis. Luckily, good wrappers and alternatives exist, at least the ymd{_h}{m}{s} suite from lubridate and Dirk Eddelbuettel’s anytime. These functions remove much of the overhead of date and datetime parsing, allowing for quick formatting of vectors in all kinds of formats. They also alleviate the pain of using seq.Date() and seq.POSIXt a little, because the from and the to arguments should be parsed dates or datetimes. Take the following example.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/unique_id/">Quickly Check your ID Variables <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-07-20T19:16:00+02:00">July 20, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Virtually every dataset has them; id variables that link a record to a subject and/or time point. Often one column, or a combination of columns, forms the unique id of a record. For instance, the combination of patient_id and visit_id, or ip_adress and visit_time. The first step in most of my analyses is almost always checking the uniqueness of a variable, or a combination of variables. If it is not unique, may assumptions about the data may be wrong, or there are data quality issues. Since I do this so often, I decided to make a little wrapper around this procedure. The unique_id function will return TRUE if the evaluated variables indeed are the unique key to a record. If not, it will return all the records for which the id variable(s) are duplicated so we can pinpoint the problem right away. It uses dplyr v.0.7.1, so make sure that it is loaded.</span></a></article></li>

That is, to take raw, timestamped data, and quickly convert it into a tidy format that can be analyzed with all the tidyverse tools. Recently, a colleague and I discovered a second use for the package that I had not anticipated: checking data quality. Every analysis should contain checking if data are as expected. In the case of timestamped data, observations are sometimes missing due to technical malfunction of the system that produced them. Here are two examples that show how pad and thicken can be leveraged to detect problems in timestamped data quickly.</span></a></article></li>

As requested by many, you are now able to use intervals of which the unit is different from 1. In earlier version the eight interval values only allowed for a single unit (e.g. year, day, hour). Now you can use any time period that is accepted by seq.Date or seq.POSIXt (e.g. 2 months, 6 hours, 5 minutes) in both thicken and pad. get_interval does test for both the interval and the unit of the interval of the datetime variable from now on.</span></a></article></li>

See the introduction blogs or the vignette(&quot;padr&quot;) for more package information. In this blog I give four more elaborate examples on how to go from raw data to insight with padr, dplyr and ggplot2. They might serve as recipes for time series problems you want to solve. The dataset emergency is available in padr, and contains about a year of emergency data in Montgomery County, PA. For this blog I only use the twelve most prevalent emergencies.</span></a></article></li>

This way we get a feel for the potential contribution of each predictor. When a lot of predictors are available one can often make a first selection and only use predictors that show univariate predictive power. Not having to sift through loads of unpromising variables can speed up learning algorithms significantly. Besides, knowing the individual predictive value can improve the data scientist’s discussion with business people. Especially when it is combined with a correlation analysis of the predictors. Due to multicollinearity variables with known predictive value might not end up in the model, which can lead to distrust towards the data scientist’s work. It is essential to report properly why some variables did not make it to a final model.</span></a></article></li>

If you have missed this, see the introduction blog or vignette(&quot;padr&quot;) for a general introduction.

One of the first cool things I learned to do in R a few years back, I got from Norman Matloff’s The Art of R Programming.

If you frequently work with data containing a timestamp, especially automatically created data, you might find this package helpful. It solves two problems that you can be confronted with when preparing datetime data for analysis. First, data is often recorded on too low a level for your analysis. For instance the timestamp records the moment up to the second, where you want to do the analysis on an hourly level. Second, when no events toke place there are typically no data records. This is sensible from a storage perspective, but often unhelpful for analyzing the data. When calculating a moving average for example, you want missing observations to have the value 0. You don’t want them to be lacking from your set.</span></a></article></li>

You have a large data set with many, many columns of which the most are irrelevant to you. Typically, a dump from a database or the full set extracted from an API. Several times I found myself the better part of an afternoon going back and forth between a view of the data where I tried to figure out which columns to keep, and an R session where I wrote the code for creating the subset of columns. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an app in which you could just click the columns you would like to keep? This seemed a perfect opportunity to get my feet wet with Shiny gadgets, which I still wanted to do since I first heard about it on useR2016.</span></a></article></li>

Of course in my day job as a data scientist I couldn’t live without it, but it also proved to be a great aid in private life.
