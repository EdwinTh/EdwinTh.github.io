Even after reading programming with dplyr several times, I still struggle when creating functions from time to time. I made a small summary of the most common actions I perform, so I don’t have to dig in the vignettes and on stackoverflow over and over. Each is accompanied with a minimal example on how to implement it. I thought others might find this useful too, so here it is in a blog post. This list is meant to be a living thing so additions and improvements are most welcome. Please do a PR on this file or send an email.</span></a></article></li>
 
  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/span_date_time/">Span Dates and Times without Overhead <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-07-26T19:00:00+02:00">July 26, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I am working on v.0.4.0 of the padr package this summer. Two new features that will be added are wrappers around seq.Date and seq.POSIXt. Since it is going to take a while before the new release is on CRAN, I go ahead and do an early presentation of these functions. Date and datetime parsing in base R are powerful and comprehensive, but also tedious. They can slow you down in your programming or analysis. Luckily, good wrappers and alternatives exist, at least the ymd{_h}{m}{s} suite from lubridate and Dirk Eddelbuettel’s anytime. These functions remove much of the overhead of date and datetime parsing, allowing for quick formatting of vectors in all kinds of formats. They also alleviate the pain of using seq.Date() and seq.POSIXt a little, because the from and the to arguments should be parsed dates or datetimes. Take the following example.</span></a></article></li>

Often one column, or a combination of columns, forms the unique id of a record. For instance, the combination of patient_id and visit_id, or ip_adress and visit_time. The first step in most of my analyses is almost always checking the uniqueness of a variable, or a combination of variables. If it is not unique, may assumptions about the data may be wrong, or there are data quality issues. Since I do this so often, I decided to make a little wrapper around this procedure. The unique_id function will return TRUE if the evaluated variables indeed are the unique key to a record. If not, it will return all the records for which the id variable(s) are duplicated so we can pinpoint the problem right away. It uses dplyr v.0.7.1, so make sure that it is loaded.</span></a></article></li>

That is, to take raw, timestamped data, and quickly convert it into a tidy format that can be analyzed with all the tidyverse tools. Recently, a colleague and I discovered a second use for the package that I had not anticipated: checking data quality. Every analysis should contain checking if data are as expected. In the case of timestamped data, observations are sometimes missing due to technical malfunction of the system that produced them. Here are two examples that show how pad and thicken can be leveraged to detect problems in timestamped data quickly.</span></a></article></li>

As requested by many, you are now able to use intervals of which the unit is different from 1. In earlier version the eight interval values only allowed for a single unit (e.g. year, day, hour). Now you can use any time period that is accepted by seq.Date or seq.POSIXt (e.g. 2 months, 6 hours, 5 minutes) in both thicken and pad. get_interval does test for both the interval and the unit of the interval of the datetime variable from now on.</span></a></article></li>

One of the first things we are taught in Introduction to Statistics and routinely applied whenever coming across a new continuous variable. However, it easily gets messed up by outliers. Putting most of the data into a single bin or a few bins, and scattering the outliers barely visible over the x-axis. This distribution might look familiar</span></a></article></li>

See the introduction blogs or the vignette(&quot;padr&quot;) for more package information. In this blog I give four more elaborate examples on how to go from raw data to insight with padr, dplyr and ggplot2. They might serve as recipes for time series problems you want to solve. The dataset emergency is available in padr, and contains about a year of emergency data in Montgomery County, PA. For this blog I only use the twelve most prevalent emergencies.</span></a></article></li>

This way we get a feel for the potential contribution of each predictor. When a lot of predictors are available one can often make a first selection and only use predictors that show univariate predictive power. Not having to sift through loads of unpromising variables can speed up learning algorithms significantly. Besides, knowing the individual predictive value can improve the data scientist’s discussion with business people. Especially when it is combined with a correlation analysis of the predictors. Due to multicollinearity variables with known predictive value might not end up in the model, which can lead to distrust towards the data scientist’s work. It is essential to report properly why some variables did not make it to a final model.</span></a></article></li>

If you have missed this, see the introduction blog or vignette(&quot;padr&quot;) for a general introduction. In v0.2.0 the pad function is extended with a group argument, which makes your life a lot easier when you want to do padding within groups.</span></a></article></li>

One of the first cool things I learned to do in R a few years back, I got from Norman Matloff’s The Art of R Programming. When you have more than one if then statements, you just nest multiple ifelse functions before you reach the else.</span></a></article></li>

If you frequently work with data containing a timestamp, especially automatically created data, you might find this package helpful. It solves two problems that you can be confronted with when preparing datetime data for analysis. First, data is often recorded on too low a level for your analysis. For instance the timestamp records the moment up to the second, where you want to do the analysis on an hourly level. Second, when no events toke place there are typically no data records. This is sensible from a storage perspective, but often unhelpful for analyzing the data. When calculating a moving average for example, you want missing observations to have the value 0. You don’t want them to be lacking from your set.</span></a></article></li>

You have a large data set with many, many columns of which the most are irrelevant to you. Typically, a dump from a database or the full set extracted from an API. Several times I found myself the better part of an afternoon going back and forth between a view of the data where I tried to figure out which columns to keep, and an R session where I wrote the code for creating the subset of columns. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an app in which you could just click the columns you would like to keep? This seemed a perfect opportunity to get my feet wet with Shiny gadgets, which I still wanted to do since I first heard about it on useR2016.</span></a></article></li>

Of course in my day job as a data scientist I couldn’t live without it, but it also proved to be a great aid in private life. Recently we bought our first house and R came to the rescue several times in the process. We compared the impact of different mortgages on our finances in ten and twenty years time and I kept an eye on our spending through a Shiny app (I’ll admit the latter would have been less time consuming if I would have done it in Excel, like normal people).</span></a></article></li>
