Over two weeks of obsessive watching everything that moves on skis, skates or boards. My tiny country of the Netherlands won about half of all the medals at the speed skating events. Since there are many medals to be won here this made it to end up high in the medal table. This makes it look as winter sports nation, where all we skating buffs. (Sadly, we can’t hardly skate anymore last years. Stop global warming everyone, the Dutch need their ice!) To me, this begged the question, are other top nations also in the high ranks because they dominate a single sport. Or are they all round snow and ice eating badasses?</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog-new-things/">Blog about something you just learned <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-02-19T21:15:00+01:00">February 19, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Great effort has recently been made to encourage also the not-so-experienced to jump into the water and blog about data science. Some of the community’s hot shots gracefully draw attention to blogs of first-times on twitter to give them extra exposure. Most of the blogger newbies write about an analysis they did on a topic they care about. That sounds like the obvious thing to do. However, I think there is a second option that is not considered by many. That is writing about a topic you just learned. This might seem strange, why would you want to tell the world about something you are by no means an expert on? Won’t you just make a fool of yourself by pretending you know stuff you just picked up? I don’t think so, let me give you four reasons why I think this is actually a good idea.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/meta-learning/">Curb your imposterism, start meta-learning <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-01-19T18:55:00+01:00">January 19, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Recently, there has been a lot of attention for the imposter syndrome. Even seasoned programmers admit they suffer from feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. Some share their personal stories, which can be comforting for those suffering in silence. I focus on a method that helped me grow confidence in recent years. It is a simple, yet very effective way to deal with being overwhelmed by the many things a data scientist can acquaint him or herself with.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/paletti/">Make your own color palettes with paletti <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-12-22T21:52:00+01:00">December 22, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Last week I blogged about the dutchmasters color palettes package, which was inspired by the wonderful ochRe package. As mentioned I shamelessly copied the package. I replaced the list with character vectors containing hex colors and did a find and replace to make it dutchmasters instead of ochRe. This was pretty ugly.  I realized that when we would refactor the  ochRe functions, thus creating functions that create the functions, there would no longer be a need to copy-paste and find-and-replace. So that is what I did. I refactored and expanded ochRe’s chore into paletti. (Name chosen because I liked the ring of it). You grab it from Github, with devtools::install_github(&quot;edwinth/paletti&quot;).</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/dutch-masters/">Color palettes derived from the Dutch masters <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-12-13T18:33:00+01:00">December 13, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Among tulip fields, canals and sampling cheese, the museums of the Netherlands are one of its biggest tourist attractions. And for very good reasons! During the seventeenth century, known as the Dutch Golden Age, there was an abundance of talented painters. If you ever havethe chance to visit the Rijksmuseum you will be in awe by the landscapes,households and portraits, painted with incredible detail and beautiful colors.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/workflow/">A two-stage workflow for data science projects <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-11-27T21:27:00+01:00">November 27, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">If you are a data scientist who primarily works with R, chances are you had no formal training in software development. I certainly did not pick up many skills in that direction during my statistics masters. For years my workflow was basically load a dataset and hack away on it. In the best case my R-script came to some kind of conclusion or final data set, but usually it abruptly ended. Complex projects could result in a great number of scripts and data exports. Needless to say, reproducability was typically low and stress could run high when some delivery went wrong.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/padr-v04/">padr version 0.4.0 now on CRAN <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-11-17T20:30:00+01:00">November 17, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I am happy to share that the latest version of padr just hit CRAN. This new version comprises bug fixes, performance improvements and new functions for formatting datetime variables. But above all, it introduces the custom paradigm that enables you to do asymmetric analysis.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/ggmm/">A ggplot-based Marimekko/Mosaic plot <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-11-02T21:00:00+01:00">November 02, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">One of my first baby steps into the open source world, was when I answered this SO question over four years ago. Recently I revisited the post and saw that Z.Lin did a very nice and more modern implementation, using dplyr and facetting in ggplot2. I decided to merge here ideas with mine to create a general function that makes MM plots. I also added two features: counts, proportions, or percentages to the cells as text and highlighting cells by a condition.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/nse/">Non-standard evaluation, how tidy eval builds on base R <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-09-10T14:30:00+02:00">September 10, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">As with many aspects of the tidyverse, its non-standard evaluation (NSE) implementation is not something entirely new, but built on top of base R. What makes this one so challenging to get your mind around, is that the Honorable Doctor Sir Lord General and friends brought concepts to the realm of the mortals that many of us had no, or only a vague, understanding of. Earlier, I gave an overview of the most common actions in tidy eval. Although appreciated by many, it left me unsatisfied, because it made clear to me I did not really understand NSE. Neither in base R, nor in tidy eval. Therefore, I bit the bullet and really studied it for a few evenings. Starting with base R NSE, and later learning what tidy eval actually adds to it. I decided to share the things I learned in this, rather lengthy, blog. I think it captures the essentials in NSE, although it surely is incomplete and might be even erronous at places. Still, I hope you find it worthwhile and it will help you understand NSE better and apply it with more confidence.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/dplyr-recipes/">Tidy evaluation, most common actions <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-08-25T20:30:00+02:00">August 25, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Tidy evaluation is a bit challenging to get your head around. Even after reading programming with dplyr several times, I still struggle when creating functions from time to time. I made a small summary of the most common actions I perform, so I don’t have to dig in the vignettes and on stackoverflow over and over. Each is accompanied with a minimal example on how to implement it. I thought others might find this useful too, so here it is in a blog post. This list is meant to be a living thing so additions and improvements are most welcome. Please do a PR on this file or send an email.</span></a></article></li>
