It is an empirical one, based on several years of doing data science projects in different organisations. Here it is: The probability that you have worked on a data science project that failed, approaches one very quickly as the number of projects done grows. I think many, far more than we as a community like to admit, will deal with projects that don’t meet their objectives. This blog does not explore why data science projects have a high risk of failing. Jonathan Nolis already  did this adequately. Rather, I’ll look for strategies how we might deal with projects that are failing. Disappointing as they may be, failed projects are inherently part of the novel and challenging discipline data science is in many organisations. The following approach might reduce the probability of failure, but that is not the main point. Their objective is to prevent failing in silence after too long a period of project time. In which you try to figure out things on your own. They will shift failure from the silent personal domain to the public collective one. Hopefully, reducing stress and blame by yourself and others.</span></a></article></li>

One of those people was actually yours truely a few years back. Person is aware of S3 methods in R through regular use of print, plot and summary functions and decides to give it a go in own work. Creates a function that assigns a class to its output and then implements a bunch of methods to work on the class. Strangely, some of these methods appear to be working as expected, while others throw an error. After a confusing and painful debugging session, person throws hands in the air and continues working without S3 methods. Which was working fine in the first place. This is a real pity, because all the person is overlooking is a very small step in the S3 chain: the generic function.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/recipes_blog/">A recipe for recipes <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-05-29T14:15:00+02:00">May 29, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">If you build statistical or machine learning models, the recipes package can be useful for data preparation. A recipe object is a container that holds all the steps that should be performed to go from the raw data set to the set that is fed into model a algorithm. Once your recipe is ready it can be executed on a data set at once, to perform all the steps. Not only on the train set on which the recipe was created, but also on new data, such as test sets and data that should be scored by the model. This assures that new data gets the exact same preparation as the train set, and thus can be validly scored by the learned model. The author of recipes, Max Kuhn, has provided abundant material to familiarize yourself with the richness of the package, see here, here, and here. I will not dwell on how to use the package. Rather, I’d like to share what in my opinion is a good way to create new steps and checks to the package1. Use of the package is probably intuitive. Developing new steps and checks, however, does require a little more understanding of the package inner workings. With this procedure, or recipe if you like, I hope you will find adding (and maybe even contributing) your own steps and checks becomes easier and more organized.            Together with Max I added the checks framework to the package. Where steps are transformations of variables, checks are assertions of them. If a check passes nothing happens. If it fails, it will break the bake method of the recipe and throws an informative error. &#8617;      </span></a></article></li>

Here I take you along how I scraped the data from wikepedia and subsequently used the tools of the tidyverse to get the data in a format in which they can be analyzed. You are invited to copy-paste the code and see how the data is gradually getting into a shape in which we can analyze it. I will often not show the data in the intermediate steps, because this will clog the blog. Copy the code to find out for yourself.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/analyzing-olympics/">Gold diggers at the Olympics <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-03-11T21:10:00+01:00">March 11, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">It came to a close two weeks ago. Over two weeks of obsessive watching everything that moves on skis, skates or boards. My tiny country of the Netherlands won about half of all the medals at the speed skating events. Since there are many medals to be won here this made it to end up high in the medal table. This makes it look as winter sports nation, where all we skating buffs. (Sadly, we can’t hardly skate anymore last years. Stop global warming everyone, the Dutch need their ice!) To me, this begged the question, are other top nations also in the high ranks because they dominate a single sport. Or are they all round snow and ice eating badasses?</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog-new-things/">Blog about something you just learned <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-02-19T21:15:00+01:00">February 19, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Great effort has recently been made to encourage also the not-so-experienced to jump into the water and blog about data science. Some of the community’s hot shots gracefully draw attention to blogs of first-times on twitter to give them extra exposure. Most of the blogger newbies write about an analysis they did on a topic they care about. That sounds like the obvious thing to do. However, I think there is a second option that is not considered by many. That is writing about a topic you just learned. This might seem strange, why would you want to tell the world about something you are by no means an expert on? Won’t you just make a fool of yourself by pretending you know stuff you just picked up? I don’t think so, let me give you four reasons why I think this is actually a good idea.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/meta-learning/">Curb your imposterism, start meta-learning <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-01-19T18:55:00+01:00">January 19, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Recently, there has been a lot of attention for the imposter syndrome. Even seasoned programmers admit they suffer from feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. Some share their personal stories, which can be comforting for those suffering in silence. I focus on a method that helped me grow confidence in recent years. It is a simple, yet very effective way to deal with being overwhelmed by the many things a data scientist can acquaint him or herself with.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/paletti/">Make your own color palettes with paletti <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-12-22T21:52:00+01:00">December 22, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Last week I blogged about the dutchmasters color palettes package, which was inspired by the wonderful ochRe package. As mentioned I shamelessly copied the package. I replaced the list with character vectors containing hex colors and did a find and replace to make it dutchmasters instead of ochRe. This was pretty ugly.  I realized that when we would refactor the  ochRe functions, thus creating functions that create the functions, there would no longer be a need to copy-paste and find-and-replace. So that is what I did. I refactored and expanded ochRe’s chore into paletti. (Name chosen because I liked the ring of it). You grab it from Github, with devtools::install_github(&quot;edwinth/paletti&quot;).</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/dutch-masters/">Color palettes derived from the Dutch masters <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-12-13T18:33:00+01:00">December 13, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Among tulip fields, canals and sampling cheese, the museums of the Netherlands are one of its biggest tourist attractions. And for very good reasons! During the seventeenth century, known as the Dutch Golden Age, there was an abundance of talented painters. If you ever havethe chance to visit the Rijksmuseum you will be in awe by the landscapes,households and portraits, painted with incredible detail and beautiful colors.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/workflow/">A two-stage workflow for data science projects <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-11-27T21:27:00+01:00">November 27, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">If you are a data scientist who primarily works with R, chances are you had no formal training in software development. I certainly did not pick up many skills in that direction during my statistics masters. For years my workflow was basically load a dataset and hack away on it. In the best case my R-script came to some kind of conclusion or final data set, but usually it abruptly ended. Complex projects could result in a great number of scripts and data exports. Needless to say, reproducability was typically low and stress could run high when some delivery went wrong.</span></a></article></li>
