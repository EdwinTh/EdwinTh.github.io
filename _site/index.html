Even seasoned programmers admit they suffer from feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. Some share their personal stories, which can be comforting for those suffering in silence. I focus on a method that helped me grow confidence in recent years. It is a simple, yet very effective way to deal with being overwhelmed by the many things a data scientis can acquaint him or herself with.</span></a></article></li>

As mentioned I shamelessly copied the package. I replaced the list with character vectors containing hex colors and did a find and replace to make it dutchmasters instead of ochRe. This was pretty ugly.  I realized that when we would refactor the  ochRe functions, thus creating functions that create the functions, there would no longer be a need to copy-paste and find-and-replace. So that is what I did. I refactored and expanded ochRe’s chore into paletti. (Name chosen because I liked the ring of it). You grab it from Github, with devtools::install_github(&quot;edwinth/paletti&quot;).</span></a></article></li>

And for very good reasons! During the seventeenth century, known as the Dutch Golden Age, there was an abundance of talented painters. If you ever havethe chance to visit the Rijksmuseum you will be in awe by the landscapes,households and portraits, painted with incredible detail and beautiful colors.</span></a></article></li>

I certainly did not pick up many skills in that direction during my statistics masters. For years my workflow was basically load a dataset and hack away on it. In the best case my R-script came to some kind of conclusion or final data set, but usually it abruptly ended. Complex projects could result in a great number of scripts and data exports. Needless to say, reproducability was typically low and stress could run high when some delivery went wrong.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/padr-v04/">padr version 0.4.0 now on CRAN <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-11-17T20:30:00+01:00">November 17, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I am happy to share that the latest version of padr just hit CRAN. This new version comprises bug fixes, performance improvements and new functions for formatting datetime variables. But above all, it introduces the custom paradigm that enables you to do asymmetric analysis.</span></a></article></li>

Recently I revisited the post and saw that Z.Lin did a very nice and more modern implementation, using dplyr and facetting in ggplot2. I decided to merge here ideas with mine to create a general function that makes MM plots. I also added two features: counts, proportions, or percentages to the cells as text and highlighting cells by a condition.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/nse/">Non-standard evaluation, how tidy eval builds on base R <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-09-10T14:30:00+02:00">September 10, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">As with many aspects of the tidyverse, its non-standard evaluation (NSE) implementation is not something entirely new, but built on top of base R. What makes this one so challenging to get your mind around, is that the Honorable Doctor Sir Lord General and friends brought concepts to the realm of the mortals that many of us had no, or only a vague, understanding of. Earlier, I gave an overview of the most common actions in tidy eval. Although appreciated by many, it left me unsatisfied, because it made clear to me I did not really understand NSE. Neither in base R, nor in tidy eval. Therefore, I bit the bullet and really studied it for a few evenings. Starting with base R NSE, and later learning what tidy eval actually adds to it. I decided to share the things I learned in this, rather lengthy, blog. I think it captures the essentials in NSE, although it surely is incomplete and might be even erronous at places. Still, I hope you find it worthwhile and it will help you understand NSE better and apply it with more confidence.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/dplyr-recipes/">Tidy evaluation, most common actions <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-08-25T20:30:00+02:00">August 25, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Tidy evaluation is a bit challenging to get your head around. Even after reading programming with dplyr several times, I still struggle when creating functions from time to time. I made a small summary of the most common actions I perform, so I don’t have to dig in the vignettes and on stackoverflow over and over. Each is accompanied with a minimal example on how to implement it. I thought others might find this useful too, so here it is in a blog post. This list is meant to be a living thing so additions and improvements are most welcome. Please do a PR on this file or send an email.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/span_date_time/">Span Dates and Times without Overhead <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-07-26T19:00:00+02:00">July 26, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">I am working on v.0.4.0 of the padr package this summer. Two new features that will be added are wrappers around seq.Date and seq.POSIXt. Since it is going to take a while before the new release is on CRAN, I go ahead and do an early presentation of these functions. Date and datetime parsing in base R are powerful and comprehensive, but also tedious. They can slow you down in your programming or analysis. Luckily, good wrappers and alternatives exist, at least the ymd{_h}{m}{s} suite from lubridate and Dirk Eddelbuettel’s anytime. These functions remove much of the overhead of date and datetime parsing, allowing for quick formatting of vectors in all kinds of formats. They also alleviate the pain of using seq.Date() and seq.POSIXt a little, because the from and the to arguments should be parsed dates or datetimes. Take the following example.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/unique_id/">Quickly Check your ID Variables <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2017-07-20T19:16:00+02:00">July 20, 2017</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Virtually every dataset has them; id variables that link a record to a subject and/or time point. Often one column, or a combination of columns, forms the unique id of a record. For instance, the combination of patient_id and visit_id, or ip_adress and visit_time. The first step in most of my analyses is almost always checking the uniqueness of a variable, or a combination of variables. If it is not unique, may assumptions about the data may be wrong, or there are data quality issues. Since I do this so often, I decided to make a little wrapper around this procedure. The unique_id function will return TRUE if the evaluated variables indeed are the unique key to a record. If not, it will return all the records for which the id variable(s) are duplicated so we can pinpoint the problem right away. It uses dplyr v.0.7.1, so make sure that it is loaded.</span></a></article></li>
