For those who don’t know what I am talking about, there are different ways of doing data science. There are the two major languages R and python, with their own implementations for analysing data. Then within R there are the different flavours of using the base language or applying the functions of the tidyverse. Within the tidyverse there is the dplyr package to do data wrangling, of which the functionality of the data.table package greatly overlaps. Each of the choices are wildly contested by users of both of the options. Oftentimes, these debates are first presented as objective comparisons between two options in which the favoured option clearly stands out. This then evokes fierce responses from the other camp and before you know it we are down to the point where we call each other’s choices not elegant or even ugly.</span></a></article></li>

You will find the main changes in the thicken function, that has gained two new arguments. First of all, by an idea of Adam Stone, you are now enabled to drop the original datetime variable from the data frame by using drop = TRUE. This argument defaults to FALSE to ensure backwards compatibility. Without setting drop to TRUE the datetime variable will be returned alongside the added, thickened variable:</span></a></article></li>

For a sports buff like me, it is the essence of summer (together with the Tour de France). Time to dive into some tennis data. As a follower of both the men’s and the women’s tour it occurred to me that in the latter the tournaments are less predictable. My gut feel was that in the men’s matches the favourite wins the match more frequently than at women’s matches. Of course gut feels are what the world makes go round, unless you are a data scientist. So lets analyse all the matches that were played at the four Grand Slam tournamants for the past fourty years.</span></a></article></li>

It involved two data scientists, two backend engineers and a data engineer, all working on-and-off on the R code during the project. The project had many interesting and new aspects to me, among them are doing data science in an agilish way, how to keep track of the different model versions and how to deal with directories, data and code on different machines. I planned to do a series of write-ups this summer, describing each of them, but then this happened</span></a></article></li>

Computations are done in a separate R session that is not interactive, but just runs the script. In the meantime your regular R session stays live so you can do other work while waiting for the Job to complete. Instead refreshing your Twitter for the 156th time, you can stay productive! (I am actually writing this blog in Rmarkdown while I am waiting for my results to come in.) The number of jobs you can spin-up is not limited to one. As each new job is started at a different core, you can start as many jobs as your system got cores (although leaving one idle is a good idea for other processes, like your interactive R session).</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/failed-projects/">Dealing with failed projects <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-11-22T09:20:00+01:00">November 22, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Recently, I came up with Thoen’s law. It is an empirical one, based on several years of doing data science projects in different organisations. Here it is: The probability that you have worked on a data science project that failed, approaches one very quickly as the number of projects done grows. I think many, far more than we as a community like to admit, will deal with projects that don’t meet their objectives. This blog does not explore why data science projects have a high risk of failing. Jacqueline Nolis already  did this adequately. Rather, I’ll look for strategies how we might deal with projects that are failing. Disappointing as they may be, failed projects are inherently part of the novel and challenging discipline data science is in many organisations. The following approach might reduce the probability of failure, but that is not the main point. Their objective is to prevent failing in silence after too long a period of project time. In which you try to figure out things on your own. They will shift failure from the silent personal domain to the public collective one. Hopefully, reducing stress and blame by yourself and others.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/s3-generics/">Why your S3 method isn't working <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-06-15T15:54:00+02:00">June 15, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">Throughout the last years I noticed the following happening with a number of people. One of those people was actually yours truely a few years back. Person is aware of S3 methods in R through regular use of print, plot and summary functions and decides to give it a go in own work. Creates a function that assigns a class to its output and then implements a bunch of methods to work on the class. Strangely, some of these methods appear to be working as expected, while others throw an error. After a confusing and painful debugging session, person throws hands in the air and continues working without S3 methods. Which was working fine in the first place. This is a real pity, because all the person is overlooking is a very small step in the S3 chain: the generic function.</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="https://EdwinTh.github.io/blog/recipes_blog/">A recipe for recipes <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2018-05-29T14:15:00+02:00">May 29, 2018</time></span> <span class="excerpt">If you build statistical or machine learning models, the recipes package can be useful for data preparation. A recipe object is a container that holds all the steps that should be performed to go from the raw data set to the set that is fed into model a algorithm. Once your recipe is ready it can be executed on a data set at once, to perform all the steps. Not only on the train set on which the recipe was created, but also on new data, such as test sets and data that should be scored by the model. This assures that new data gets the exact same preparation as the train set, and thus can be validly scored by the learned model. The author of recipes, Max Kuhn, has provided abundant material to familiarize yourself with the richness of the package, see here, here, and here. I will not dwell on how to use the package. Rather, I’d like to share what in my opinion is a good way to create new steps and checks to the package1. Use of the package is probably intuitive. Developing new steps and checks, however, does require a little more understanding of the package inner workings. With this procedure, or recipe if you like, I hope you will find adding (and maybe even contributing) your own steps and checks becomes easier and more organized.            Together with Max I added the checks framework to the package. Where steps are transformations of variables, checks are assertions of them. If a check passes nothing happens. If it fails, it will break the bake method of the recipe and throws an informative error. &#8617;      </span></a></article></li>

Here I take you along how I scraped the data from wikepedia and subsequently used the tools of the tidyverse to get the data in a format in which they can be analyzed. You are invited to copy-paste the code and see how the data is gradually getting into a shape in which we can analyze it. I will often not show the data in the intermediate steps, because this will clog the blog. Copy the code to find out for yourself.</span></a></article></li>

Over two weeks of obsessive watching everything that moves on skis, skates or boards. My tiny country of the Netherlands won about half of all the medals at the speed skating events. Since there are many medals to be won here this made it to end up high in the medal table. This makes it look as winter sports nation, where all we skating buffs. (Sadly, we can’t hardly skate anymore last years. Stop global warming everyone, the Dutch need their ice!) To me, this begged the question, are other top nations also in the high ranks because they dominate a single sport. Or are they all round snow and ice eating badasses?</span></a></article></li>
